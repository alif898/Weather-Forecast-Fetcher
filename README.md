# Weather-Forecast-Fetcher

## Introduction

I love to cycle during my free time and weather is always something we need to check before heading out.
Unfortuantely I can be a bit absent-minded on this and many times I chose a route that was going to rain, which usually means I have to cut my session short, especially if the rain is too heavy.
Of course, there are many weather related apps and services which can help me with this, but naturally, I was keen to build my own custom solution.
The idea is to find a source of weather forecast data, build an ETL pipeline to take this data, store in somewhere before delivering the weather forecasts in a way that is convenient to me, such as through an email or link that I can access easily.

This writeup will be cover the following parts:
 1. System design
 2. Data visualisation
 3. Instructions on how to use this repo
